Sharing and going through each other's submissions meant I had to step into their logic: I traced their example [4, 5, 6, 4, 6] step by step and followed how the set tracks seen elements, which helped me explain in my own words why their solution is correct and what its time and space complexity are. I also noticed in their write-up that the complexity was described in a way that could confuse O(n) with O(1), and I suggested clarifying that in my critique. The presentation and review experience with my partner showed me how useful it is to read someone else's code and reasoning carefully and to give constructive feedback.
